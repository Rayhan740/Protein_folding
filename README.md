# Protein Folding Project

### Introduction
This repository contains the implementation and results of the Protein Folding Project completed on 29 June 2023. The project was undertaken as part of the QuantumAI platform, an Indian quantum computing initiative.

### Project Overview
The objective of the project was to explore the fascinating realm of protein folding using quantum computing techniques. The protein folding problem, a fundamental challenge in biology, involves predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. In this project, we aimed to leverage the power of quantum algorithms to tackle this complex problem.

### Methodology
To tackle the protein folding problem, a polypeptide chain was selected, consisting of 10 amino acids. We employed Hamiltonian encoding to encode the chain into a qubit operator, ensuring the satisfaction of physical constraints. The encoded chain was then subjected to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, to minimize the energy and determine the protein's lowest energy conformation.

Throughout the project, we explored various interaction models, including mixed interactions and custom interaction maps, to gain insights into the folding process. Additionally, we investigated the applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as an alternative approach to address the folding problem.

### Results
The project culminated in obtaining the lowest energy conformations for the protein folding problem using VQE. By measuring and optimizing the output through classical algorithms, we obtained valuable insights into the intricate folding patterns of the protein. The results shed light on the interplay between amino acid sequences, interactions, and energy landscapes, contributing to our understanding of protein folding dynamics.

### Conclusion
Completing this protein folding project has been a stimulating and enlightening journey. It has showcased the potential of quantum computing in tackling complex biological problems and deepening our understanding of protein structures. We express our gratitude to QuantumAI for providing this opportunity to explore the frontiers of quantum-assisted research.
